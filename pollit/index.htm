# Installation Procedures:
 #
   #######################


1) files that start w/ a underscore (_) you can leave alone. (Edit
   these files for customization after you have the Poll It script running)

   
2) Now view the Poll It.cgi file in your browser, NOT THE Poll_It_SSI_v2.0.cgi
   file, this file is to be used w/ SSI (Server Side Includes), not through
   the browser by itself (See using Poll_It_SSI.cgi below)

   You should now get an output from the poll.cgi script in your 
   browser.

   Now Visit:  poll.cgi?load=login   in your browser to start creating you
               online polls.

#
#  Using Poll_It_SSI.cgi within a HTML Page:
 #
   #########################################


   The filename packaged w/ this script named 'Poll_It_SSI_v2.0.cgi'
   is the CGI Script used w/ SSI (Server Side Includes) to import
   your poll on an existing web page.

   To use SSI within HTML files you must have 
   an *.shtml extension rather than *.html on your pages.  This allows
   you to execute a command to include a CGI Output in your html file.

   Now to input the Poll_It_SSI_v2.0.cgi script into an HTML page, use this 
   code (After finding out what you need to use for SSI calls from the
         above explanation):

   &lt;!--#exec cgi="/pollit/Poll_It_SSI_v2.0.cgi" -->


   The above tag will look for the *.cgi file at the location specified
   & if there will output your current poll running into your web page.
