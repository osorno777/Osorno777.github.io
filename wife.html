<P ALIGN=CENTER><b>Christian Ph.D. Investment Adviser/part-time university professor seeking a faithful wife</b></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER>...that he can adore, cherish, and love romantically.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I should be fair up front and warn any woman reading this page that it is <i>intended</i> to disuade nearly all women from being interested in me.  Call it a filter if you will.  After all, I only want to have <i>one</i> wife and I trust, therefore, that this tool will prove to be a useful signal.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><b>ABOUT ME</b></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I am a 38 year old professional seeking marriage with a faithful, committed Christian woman.  I have been divorced since November 13, 2000 on account of my ex-wife's multiple adulteries over the preceding several years.  I presently have custody of my six children, who are generally pleasant, obedient, and precocious, ages 5 through 13 (four boys, two girls).  Their names are Joshua Stuart, David Jonathan, Daniel Josiah, Grace Elizabeth, Matthew Stonewall, and Rachel Hope. People at times inquire about my eligibility to remarry.  Throughout the ordeal, my pastor in Chile counseled me that I had <i>both</i> a biblical right to divorce my ex-wife <i>and</i> a right to remarry &#151; according to Matthew 19:9.  Although far from perfect, I was faithful to my ex-wife.  My ex-wife has repented and, although divorced, she is still interested in maintaining her relationship with her children and participating in their homeschooling.  If my new wife is not bothered by her presence, she could be a help with the kids after I am remarried.  Otherwise, another arrangement would be made that is most comfortable for my wife.  If all continues to go well with my ex-wife's recovery to a godly life, I am obligated to switch to a joint custody situation in the first half of 2002.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I am Reformed Baptist (i.e. a Calvinistic Baptist &#151; one who believes in the sovereignty of God's grace in salvation per the <a href="http://www.ccel.org/creeds/bcf/bcf.htm"><i>London Baptist Confession of Faith of 1689</i></a>, amillennial, non-dispensational, non-theonomist, non-charismatic).  The Christian faith is very important in my life.  Please read my <a href="http://www.PolicyOfLiberty.net/testimony.html">testimony</a>.  I currently live in Oxnard, on California's coast between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara.  I am a member (as are my three eldest sons) of Faith Community Church in Oxnard.  I am always an active church member, and have participated in the past by teaching on topics like abortion and homeschooling.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I am 6 ft. 3 in. in height, and I weigh around 245 pounds (although I have fluctuated between 222 lbs. and 258 lbs. over the last few years).  I should be 220 lbs. or 225 lbs. so I am always dieting a little (i.e. <a href="http://www.slimfast.com/products/ready.asp">Slim Fast</a> and <a href="http://tsangenterprise.com/gluco.htm">glucomannan herbal capsules</a> are my good friends!).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Note that I am strong in faith, intellect, and conviction, but not particularly in muscles.  So if you are looking for some guy with a "great body" then you probably need to look elsewhere, especially because I am not interested in women who have such things as an important criteria.  I am healthy, honest, loyal, decisive, persistent, and hard working.  In choosing a mate, I value all of those kinds of things far more than vain things (like breast size) so commonly heralded in today's world.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I do not smoke now, and never have smoked cigarettes or cigars.  Ditto for chewing tobacco.  I seldom drink, but do on certain social occasions (but I can count all of the glasses of wine, or sometimes beer, that I drink in a whole year on two hands normally).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I am presently starting a new career as an independent financial consultant.  I am an Investment Adviser, Principal, and Options Principal with Montauk Financial Group.  I also endeavor to teach economics and public policy courses (part time) in local universities.  I am willing to relocate in 2002 or 2003, even to another country if the Lord leads me there. For instance, we might like to return to Chile where we lived for 4 1/2 years.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I am hard working, honest, persistent, faithful, and a good father.  I spend a lot of time with my kids.  We faithfully attend church.  My oldest four children have been baptized.  They are faithful and would be a plus by nearly any estimation.  I am strict, analytical, and hard-driving but I love to travel and have fun as well.  I can be quite romantic if I found a woman who truly loved me and was faithful to me.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I have been a believer for about 23 years. I like to write books and articles on public policy and economics.  I love conversation.  I love to be on email lists for logical discussion. I have my own web page.  I like reading and playing chess.  I spend many hours with my kids and we go camping, snow skiing, and touring.  Indeed, I have lived abroad and traveled extensively: Chile (4 1/2 years), Guatemala (6 weeks), New Zealand (3 weeks), Jordan (2 months), and Iran (2 months), plus considerable travel in Argentina (3x), Belgium, Bolivia, Canada (8x), Czech Republic, Egypt (2x), England (2x), France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Israel, Mexico (8x), Netherlands, Peru (3x), Switzerland, Tahiti, Uruguay, as well as 49 USA states (all but Alaska).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I have very strong convictions: no TV, homeschooling only, spanking when necessary, and regular church attendance.  I do not have a temper (I never hit my ex-wife for instance in over 16 years of marriage).  I am bilingual English/Spanish (native speakers of Spanish put my level at 7 or 8 on a scale of 1 to 10) and I have taught many economics and business courses in Spanish.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I am an ENTJ temperament type on Myers-Briggs.  Please click <a href="http://www.keirsey.com/personality/ntej.html">here</a> to read a description of my temperament score.  I have 5 college degrees (Ph.D., M.A., M.A., B.A., A.R.E. in fields of public policy, economics, finance/management, and religious education) and would like to find a well-educated woman if possible.  I am not rich, nor do I expect to be, but I am a good provider of a middle to upper middle class lifestyle.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>What are my greatest weaknesses?  Well, the primary one is a lack of sensitivity at times.  Improvement in this sin area is slow, so that the woman who marries me might have to be willing to live with this weakness for some time to come.  If you can imagine the obliviousness of the stereotypical "absent-minded professor" then you can partly get an idea of me.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><b>MY IDEAL WOMAN</b></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I realize that it will be a very special and unusual woman who will be attracted to me.  But I believe that God has prepared such a woman.  I would have to find a solid Christian woman with similar temperament and convictions as mine, who I feel attracted to (i.e., pretty and not terribly overweight), who is strongly committed to Jesus Christ (and likely to a Calvinistic point of view).  She should be sexually faithful in general (this does not mean that she has to be a virgin if she has never married, but that being such is or even has been the goal of her life, and that she has not been promiscuous), or a widow/divorced woman who was faithful to her husband (i.e., the innocent party divorced for cause of adultery or desertion).  She will like kids (and may even have some of her own) and homeschooling.  She must be willing to tolerate the consequences of standing up for the truth.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Temperament is crucial for me. As my companion, I would hope that my wife would have a similar temperament as mine, rather than my opposite.  Thus, she should be analytical, well-organized and hard-working (Prov. 31:13-18) &#151; an ESTJ, an ESFJ, or an NT type (INTJ, ENTJ, ENTP or possibly an INTP) on the Myers-Briggs sorter.  Click <a href="http://www.advisorteam.com/user/kts.asp">here</a> to find out your temperament type by taking the 70 question temperament sorter. Note that I do not hold these scores as paramount in decision-making about a prospective wife, but as excellent indicators that help me (like most science when not abused) to make better informed and principled decisions about choosing my future mate and knowing a bit about how she views the world.  (I would certainly never rely on such scores to deny the role of the Holy Spirit in sanctification as I have heard some have errantly done.)</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>She must have a strong Christian commitment which includes being faithful (Prov. 31:11-12), submissive (Eph. 5:22, Col. 3:18, I Pet. 3:1), domestic (Titus 2:5), strongly pro-life, disliking TV, being committed to homeschooling, and hating the public school (probably disliking government in general).  My preference, although it is not crucial, is that she be Baptistic and Calvinistic too, but above all God-fearing and faithful.  Here are some things she will <i>not</i> be: (a) a staunch charismatic, (b) into women being elders or teaching men (in violation of I Cor. 14:34 and I Tim. 2:11-12), (c) probably not dispensational, (d) certainly not into Benny Hinn or Robert Schuller, and (e) not opposed to spanking (Prov. 13:24).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I prefer strongly to also be physically attracted to her.  Ideally, but not of necessity, her age will be between 27 and 39.  She will probably be taller, pretty in my estimation, and not much overweight (i.e., no more than 15%-20% above her normal weight).</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I prefer Caucasian women (but not strongly), longer hair, and would be happy if she were from North America, New Zealand, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Britain, and perhaps some other places as well. I will not marry with a state marriage license next time (I will use a church <a href="http://www.policyofliberty.net/CovenantMarriage.html">marriage covenant</a> instead).  The state should have nothing to do with marriage and its involvement has only led to distortion in public policy.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Of course, she must love kids, cooking, traveling.  She should at least be interested in things like camping, snow skiing, volleyball and chess.  She should not be fanatical about pets (e.g., super "cat lover" or someone adamant that animals will be in heaven, such that the pet would take up a large part of our domestic lives or thoughts).  Being bilingual English/Spanish would be a nice plus, as would being missions-minded.  Conformably, she should at least be open to the idea of moving around at times (if God wills) &#151; even to another country &#151; for my career or for Christian service.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I like children and am not opposed to having more.  Thus, I would not mind if my wife already has children of her own.</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In late 2001, I experienced a broken engagement with a (usually) wonderful east-coast gal who found it too dificult to deal with my occassional insensitivity (even though that sin was confessed and despite my commitment to work on this area).  I do not blame her.  In fact, I would be willing to concede that the breakdown was my fault, whether directly or indirectly, whether explicitly or implicitly.  I only report it here to be honest with any woman who might be considering me.  Mainly, she seemed unable to completely overcome the fact that she was not physically (facially) attractive to me.  It turned out to be of <b>paramount</b> importance to her (though at some moments more strongly than others) that I think she is physically attractive.  While it was not of paramount importance to me by then (because the beauty of her other qualities by far overcame the physical aspects), in my next relationship I will be sure to emphasize this physical aspect more so as to not generate the same problem.  She also found submission to be a (perhaps insurmountable) difficulty at times, although she was able to show submissive actions in some key areas.  She believed the biblical doctrine but was not able (or at least not very willing) to try to implement it during our engagement at first (in order to assure me and assuage my doubts).  As everything hit a low point, she did finally offer to try it if we were engaged once again.  By then, although by no means closing the door to what God may do in the future, I had become too worried about the who relationship being feigned by her.  I hope the woman reading my profile will appreciate my honesty and sincerity &#151; no matter what woman God may bring my way in the future.  Maybe any other woman considering me should be wary given this recent breakdown.  I am willing to take that risk so long as I can maintain my integrity and be honest about it all.</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><b>POSTSCRIPT</b></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>I know these paragraphs are very specific, but I hope you will take them as my attempt to identify clearly and plainly what I am looking for, rather than a demonstration that I am hard-to-please.  The reality is that I am a fairly easy-going man in many ways.  I am not willing to write off a woman for every little fault or because she fails some absolute requirement.  Circumstances and the possibility for change mandate some flexibility, and I am open to possibilities up to a point.  Nevertheless, I do see some value in revealing my preferences to nip improbable relationships at the bud, as an exercise to make me think hard about what I desire, and to help prospective mates quickly identify what I am like.  If I still sound interesting to you (Wow &#151; you could be the one for me and me for you!), please <a href="mailto:jcobin@policyofliberty.net">email me</a>, telling me a bit about yourself, your temperament score from <a href="http://www.advisorteam.com/user/kts.asp">Myers-Briggs</a> (noted above), and please include a recent photo of you.  If you are repulsed by what I have had to say above, then I think it is fair to say that the page has done its job by filtering out non-likely candidates.  If that is the case, there is no need to write to me, either to complain about my page, standards, or to disagree with my views. I uploaded this page to attract a good wife, not to encourage debate on topics.  So far, I have attracted a fair number of good candidates.  Thanks for taking time to read my page!</P>
