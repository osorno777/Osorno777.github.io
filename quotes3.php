<p class="pl"><b>“I believe there are more instances of the abridgement of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.”</b>
<br>—USA President James Madison, Speech in the Virginia Convention (June 16, 1788)<br><br>
<b>“One man with courage makes a majority.”</b>
<br>—USA President Andrew Jackson<br><br>
<b>“My toast would be, may our country always be successful, but whether successful or otherwise, always right.”</b>
<br>—USA President John Q. Adams, Letter to John Adams (1816)<br><br>
<b>“When more of the people's sustenance is exacted through the form of taxation than is necessary to meet the just obligations of government and expenses of its economical administration, such exaction becomes ruthless extortion and a violation of the fundamental principles of a free government.”</b>
<br>—USA President Grover Cleveland, Second Annual Message (December, 1886)<br><br>
<b>“The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings; The inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries.”</b>
<br>—British Prime Minister Winston Churchill<br><br>
<b>“It must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures.”</b>
<br>—USA President Harry S Truman, speech on aid to Greece and Turkey (March 12, 1947)<br><br>
<b>“The Communist world has great resources, and it looks strong. But there is a fatal flaw in their society. Theirs is a godless system, a system of slavery; there is no freedom in it, no consent. The Iron Curtain, the secret police, the constant purges, all these are symptoms of a great basic weakness -- the rulers' fear of their own people. In the long run the strength of our free society, and our ideals, will prevail over a system that has respect for neither God nor man.”</b>
<br>—USA President Harry S Truman, Farewell Address (January 15, 1953)<br><br>
<b>“Americans, indeed all free men, remember that in the final choice a soldier's pack is not so heavy a burden as a prisoner's chains.”</b>
<br>—USA President Dwight D. Eisenhower, First Inaugural Address (January 20, 1953)<br><br>
<b>“An economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance our budget, just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits.”</b>
<br>—USA President John F. Kennedy, New York, (December 14, 1962)<br><br>
<b>“The family is the cornerstone of our society. More than any other force it shapes the attitude, the hopes, the ambitions, and the values of the child. And when the family collapses it is the children that are usually damaged. When it happens on a massive scale the community itself is crippled. So, unless we work to strengthen the family, to create conditions under which most parents will stay together, all the rest -- schools, playgrounds, and public assistance, and private concern -- will never be enough.”</b>
<br>—USA President Lyndon Johnson (June 4, 1965)<br><br>
<b>“How do you tell a communist? Well, it’s someone who reads Marx and Lenin. And how do you tell an anti-Communist? It’s someone who understands Marx and Lenin.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan<br><br>
<b>“Well I've said it before and I'll say it again -- America's best days are yet to come. Our proudest moments are yet to be. Our most glorious achievements are just ahead. America remains what Emerson called her 150 years ago, 'the country of  tomorrow.' What a wonderful description and how true. And yet tomorrow might never have happened had we lacked the courage in the 1980's to chart a course of strength and honor.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan's Speech at the  1992 National Convention<br><br>
<b>“Welfare's purpose should be to eliminate, as far as possible, the need for its own existence.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, Los Angeles Times (January 7, 1970)<br><br>
<b>“It is not my intention to do away with government. It is rather to make it work -- work with us, not over us; stand by our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, First Inaugural Address (January 20, 1981)<br><br>
<b>“This Administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, First Inaugural Address (January 20, 1981)<br><br>
<b>“[N]o arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women.”</b>

<b>“Cures were developed for which there were no known diseases.”</b>

<b>“Please tell me you're Republicans.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, to surgeons as he entered the operating room (March 30, 1981)<br><br>
<b>“The years ahead are great ones for this country, for the cause of freedom.... The West won't contain communism. It will transcend communism. It will dismiss it as some bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages are even now being written.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, Notre Dame (May 17, 1981)<BR><br>
<b>“We who live in free market societies believe that growth, prosperity and ultimately human fulfillment, are created from the bottom up, not the government down. Only when the human spirit is allowed to invent and create, only when individuals are given a personal stake in deciding economic policies and benefiting from their success -- only then can societies remain economically alive, dynamic, progressive, and free. Trust the people. This is the one irrefutable lesson of the entire postwar period contradicting the notion that rigid government controls are essential to economic development.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan (September 29, 1981)<br><br>
<b>"The size of the federal budget is not an appropriate barometer of social conscience or charitable concern.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, address to the National Alliance of Business (October 5, 1981)<br><br>
<b>“Government has an important role in helping develop a country's economic foundation. But the critical test is whether government is genuinely working to liberate individuals by creating incentives to work, save, invest, and succeed.”</b>

<b>“Government is the people's business and every man, woman and child becomes a shareholder with the first penny of tax paid.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, address to the New York City Partnership Association (January 14, 1982)<br><br>
<b>“We don't have a trillion-dollar debt because we haven't taxed enough; we have a trillion-dollar debt because we spend too much.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, address to National Association of Realtors (March 28, 1982)<br><br>
<b>“It is the Soviet Union that runs against the tide of history.... [It is] the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, speech to Britain's Parliament (1982)<br><br>
<b>“Let us beware that while they [Soviet rulers] preach the supremacy of the state, declare its omnipotence over individual man, and predict its eventual domination over all the peoples of the earth, they are the focus of evil in the modern world.... I urge you to beware the temptation ... to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of any evil empire, to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong, good and evil.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, speech to the National Association of Evangelicals (March 8, 1983)<br><br>
<b>“I call upon the scientific community in our country, those who gave us nuclear weapons, to turn their great talents now to the cause of mankind and world peace, to give us the means of rendering those nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, address to the Nation (March 23, 1983)<br><br>
<b>“There are no such things as limits to growth, because there are no limits on the human capacity for intelligence, imagination and wonder.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, address to the University of South Carolina, Columbia (September 20, 1983)<br><br>
<b>“History teaches that wars begin when governments believe the price of aggression is cheap.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, address to the nation (January 16, 1984)<br><br>
<b>“We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will always be prepared, so we may always be free.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, Normandy, France (June 6, 1984)<br><br>
<b>“The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right, faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God would grant them mercy on this beachhead or the next. It was the deep knowledge — and pray God we have not lost it — that there is a profound moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for conquest.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, Normandy, France (June 6, 1984)<br><br>
<b>“We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them -- this morning, as they prepared for their journey, and waved good-bye, and 'slipped the surly bonds of earth' to 'touch the face of God.'”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, speech about the Challenger disaster (January 28, 1986)<br><br>
<b>“Government growing beyond our consent had become a lumbering giant, slamming shut the gates of opportunity, threatening to crush the very roots of our freedom. What brought America back? The American people brought us back — with quiet courage and common sense; with undying faith that in this nation under God the future will be ours, for the future belongs to the free.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, State of the Union Address (February 4, 1986)<br><br>
<b>"[G]overnment's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, remarks to the White House Conference on Small Business (August 15, 1986)<br><br>
<b>“The other day, someone told me the difference between a democracy and a people's democracy. It's the same difference between a jacket and a straitjacket.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, remarks at Human Rights Day event (December 10, 1986)<br><br>
<b>“Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, speech near the Berlin Wall, 1987<br><br>
<b>"A friend of mine was asked to a costume ball a short time ago. He slapped some egg on his face and went as a liberal economist.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, February 11, 1988<br><br>
<b>“Freedom is the right to question and change the established way of doing things. It is the continuous revolution of the marketplace. It is the understanding that allows to recognize shortcomings and seek solutions.”</b>
<br>—USA President Ronald Wilson Reagan, address to students at Moscow State University (May 31, 1988)<br><br>
<b>“The best minds are not in government. If any were, business would hire them away.”</b>

<br>—Margaret Thatcher, address to the Pilgrim's Society (January 30, 1981)<br><br>
<b>“Wars are not caused by the buildup of weapons. They are caused when an aggressor believes he can achieve his objectives at an acceptable price.”</b>

<br>—Margaret Thatcher, speech to a Conservative Party Conference (October 14, 1988)<br><br>
<b>“[C]ommunist regimes were not some unfortunate aberration, some historical deviation from a socialist ideal. They were the ultimate expression, unconstrained by democratic and electoral pressures, of what socialism is all about.... In short, the state [is] everything and the individual nothing.”</b>
<br>—Margaret Thatcher (March 8, 1991)<br><br>

<br>—Margaret Thatcher, Right Thinking<br><br>
<b>“Because the regime is captive to its own lies, it must falsify everything. It falsifies the past. It falsifies the present, and it falsifies the future. It falsifies statistics. It pretends not to possess an omnipotent and unprincipled police apparatus. It pretends to respect human rights. It pretends to prosecute no one. It pretends to fear nothing. It pretends to pretend nothing.”</b>
<br>—Czech President Vaclav Havel, The Power of the Powerless (1978)<br><br>
<b>“My dear fellow citizens: For forty years you have heard from my predecessors on this day different variations of the same theme: how our country flourished, how many millions of tons of steel we produced, how happy we all were, how we trusted our government, and what bright perspectives were unfolding in front of us. I assume you did not propose me for this office so that I, too, would lie to you...[W]e live in a contaminated moral environment. We have fallen morally ill because we became used to saying one thing and thinking another. We have learned not to believe in anything, to ignore each other, to care only about ourselves. Notions such as love, friendship, compassion, humility, or forgiveness have lost their depth and dimensions...The previous regime ... reduced man to a means of production and nature to a tool of production. Thus it attacked both their very essence and their mutual relationship. It reduced gifted and autonomous people to nuts and bolts in some monstrously huge, noisy, and stinking machine.”</b>
<br>—Czech President Vaclav Havel, New Year's (1990) address to the Czech and Slovak people<br><br>
<b>“[O]ur souls contain exactly the contrary of what [the communists] wanted. They wanted us not to believe in God, and our churches are full. They wanted us to be materialistic and incapable of sacrifices; we are anti-materialistic, capable of sacrifice. They wanted us to be afraid of the tanks, of the guns, and instead we don't fear them at all.”</b>
