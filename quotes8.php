<p class="pl"><b>“We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honor and are shocked to find traitors in our midst. We castrate and then bid the geldings to be fruitful.”</b>
<br>—C. S. Lewis, The Abolition of Man<br><br>
<b>“[N]owhere on the planet, nowhere in history, was there a regime more vicious, more bloodthirsty, and at the same time more cunning than the Bolshevik, the self-styled Soviet regime.”</b>
<br>—Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Gulag Archipelago<br><br>
<b>“To reject this inhuman Communist ideology is simply to be a human being. Such a rejection is more than a political act. It is a protest of our souls against those who would have us forget the concepts of good and evil.”</b>
<br>—Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Warning to the West<br><br>
<b>“We have placed too much hope in politics and social reforms, only to find out that we were being deprived of our most precious possession: our spiritual life.”</b>
<br>—Alexander Solzhenitsyn, A World Split Apart<br><br>
<b>“Patriotism means unqualified and unwavering love for the nation, which implies not uncritical eagerness to serve, not support for unjust claims, but frank assessment of its vices and sins, and penitence for them.”</b>
<br>—Alexander Solzhenitsyn, From Under the Rubble<br><br>
<b>“European democracy was originally imbued with a sense of Christian responsibility and self-discipline, but these spiritual principles have been gradually losing their force. Spiritual independence is being pressured on all sides by the dictatorship of self-satisfied vulgarity, of the latest fads, and of group interests.”</b>
<br>—Alexander Solzhenitsyn, From Under the Rubble<br><br>
<b>“To coexist with communism on the same planet is impossible. Either it will spread, cancer-like, to destroy mankind, or else mankind will have to rid itself of communism (and even then face lengthy treatment for secondary tumors).”</b>
<br>—Alexander Solzhenitsyn, The Mortal Danger<br><br>
<b>“Communism will never be halted by negotiations or through the machinations of detente. It can only be halted by force from without or by disintegration from within.”</b>
<br>—Alexander Solzhenitsyn, The Mortal Danger<br><br>
<b>“If there is one profoundly reactionary sector in Latin America, it is the leftist intellectuals. They are a people without memory. I have never heard one of them admit he made a mistake. Marxism has become an intellectual vice. It is the superstition of the entire century.”</b>
<br>—Octavio Paz, Quoted by Alan Riding, New York Times (May 3, 1979)<br><br>
<b>“Giving money and power to government is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys.”</b>
<br>—P.J. O'Rourke, Parliament of Whores<br><br>
<b>“What is this oozing behemoth, this fibrous tumor, this monster of power and expense hatched from the simple human desire for civic order? How did an allegedly free people spawn a vast, rampant cuttlefish of dominion with its tentacles in every orifice of the body politic?”</b>
<br>—P.J. O'Rourke, Parliament of Whores<br><br>
<b>“Wealth is, for most people, the only honest and likely path to liberty. With money comes power over the world. Men are freed from drudgery, women from exploitation. Businesses can be started, homes built, communities formed, religions practiced, educations pursued. But liberals aren't very interested in such real and material freedoms. They have a more innocent — not to say toddlerlike — idea of freedom. Liberals want the freedom to put anything into their mouths, to say bad words and to expose their private parts in art museums.”</b>
<br>—P.J. O'Rourke, Give War a Chance<br><br>
<b>“At the core of liberalism is the spoiled child — miserable, as all spoiled children are, unsatisfied, demanding, ill-disciplined, despotic, and useless. Liberalism is a philosophy of sniveling brats.”</b>
<br>—P.J. O'Rourke, Give War a Chance<br><br>
<b>“There is only one basic human right, the right to do as you damn well please.”</b>
<br>—P.J. O'Rourke, Speech to the Cato Institute (1993)<br><br>
<b>“There are just two rules of governance in a free society: Mind your own business. Keep your hands to yourself.”</b>
<br>—P.J. O'Rourke, Speech to the Cato Institute (1993)<br><br>
<b>“If you think health care is expensive now, wait until you see what it costs when it's free.”</b>
<br>—P.J. O'Rourke, Speech to the Cato Institute (1993)<br><br>
<b>“Poverty and suffering are not due to the unequal distribution of goods and resources, but to the unequal distribution of capitalism.”</b>
<br>—Rush Limbaugh, Policy Review, Summer 1992<br><br>
<b>“I have come up with a new national symbol for the United States. I think we need to junk the eagle and come up with a symbol that is more appropriate for the kind of government we have today. We need to replace the eagle with a huge sow that has a lot of nipples and a bunch of fat little piglets hanging on them, all trying to suckle as much nourishment from them as possible.”</b>
<br>—Rush Limbaugh, The Way Things Ought to Be<br><br>
<b>“I prefer to call the most obnoxious feminists what they really are: feminazis.”</b>
<br>—Rush Limbaugh, The Way Things Ought to Be<br><br>
<b>“The argument that the West was somehow to blame for world poverty was itself a Western invention. Like decolonization, it was a product of guilt, the prime dissolvent of order and justice.”</b>
<br>—Paul Johnson, Modern Times<br><br>
<b>“By early 1933, therefore, the two largest and strongest of Europe were firmly in the grip of totalitarian regimes which preached and practiced, and indeed embodied, moral relativism, with all its horrifying potentialities.”</b>
<br>—Paul Johnson, Modern Times<br><br>
<b>“Throughout these years, the power of the State to do evil expanded with awesome speed. Its power to do good grew slowly and ambiguously.”</b>
<br>—Paul Johnson, Modern Times</p></td></tr></table><br>
