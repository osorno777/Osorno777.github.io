<P ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#6b0094"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif"><FONT SIZE=4>For
the last twenty years, Herm&oacute;genes P&eacute;rez de Arce has
maintained a regular weekly column in <I>El Mercurio</I>, Chile&#146;s
largest daily newspaper. His policy-relevant arguments have been both
original and candid, following his personal style. He delights in
calling to remembrance certain historical facts and circumstances
which are commonly forgotten by Chileans. He is a journalist and
college professor, with a first degree in law and a graduate degree
in economics. Since the 1998 arrest of former Chilean President
Augusto Pinochet in London, he has concentrated on bringing the truth
of the Chilean experience to a world which seems to be quite ignorant
of what actually transpired in this small country. Thus, he has a
well-defined objective (corresponding to his normal journalistic
custom) of defending Pinochet before the people of the West, which he
believes have been ill-informed by popular media accounts and leftist
activists. Deeply motivated by the issue, and convinced that it is
more political than judicial, he has vigorously worked to present
background information given two concerns. First, he is convinced
that the historical record and truth have been altered. Second, he
believes that adherence to basic judicial rules has been seriously
lacking in the Pinochet case. In sum, Pinochet, who is currently a
Chilean Senator, has been subjected to an &#147;undue process&#148;.
Accordingly, this term has been used as the title of this small book
in his defense.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#804c19"><FONT SIZE=4>The
request of the Spanish lawyer, Joan Garc&eacute;s, previously advisor
to Salvador Allende, to the investigating magistrate and former
socialist Member of the Spanish Parliament, Baltasar Garz&oacute;n,
to open a case against the former President of Chile, Augusto
Pinochet, goes against all the rules of due process. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#804c19"><FONT SIZE=4>If
the accused had been an ordinary citizen of a more or less civilised
country, he would have been at once protected by an appeal of <I>habeus
corpus</I> in his favour and would have been immediately given his
freedom.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#804c19"><FONT SIZE=4>The
European left, however, has succeeded in depriving Augusto Pinochet
of the most fundamental right, guaranteed for almost eight hundred
years since the Magna Carta, that of not being illegally arrested.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#804c19"><FONT SIZE=4>For
six days, Augusto Pinochet was deprived of liberty, as the result of
a Spanish request that was not based on even the most minimum legal
requirements, as it was eventually recognized by the British Justice,
that required a new request.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#804c19"><FONT SIZE=4>Additionally,
senator Pinochet was arrested in a surprise night time intrusion,
moments after painful surgery, and was left unjustifiably for hours
deprived of painkillers and suffering intense pain.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#804c19"><FONT SIZE=4>Even
if this irregular procedure was later corrected, there remains a
complete lack of justification for submitting Augusto Pinochet to
trial. Nobody has ever presented even a single proof that he
committed any of the crimes he has been accused of. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#804c19"><FONT SIZE=4>One of those crimes did not
occur at all. It simply did not happen in Chile: that is, genocide.
The obvious falsity of some of the accusations, designed to give the
impression that such kind of crimes were perpetrated, like the
persecution of Jews, has provoked the indignant rebuttal of Chileans
of Jewish origin. The accusation of persecution against the Mapuche
minority has been also contradicted by the public and collective
appreciation expressed to the then President Pinochet, at the end of
his mandate, by the most renowned representatives of the Mapuches.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#804c19"><FONT SIZE=4>Moreover,
the Agreement on genocide, on which the accusation is based,
explicitly states that the competent court is that of the place where
the crime was committed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#804c19"><FONT SIZE=4>He
is being charged as committing &#145;genocide&#146; for having
supposedly persecuted a political group, whereas this crime is
defined as the persecution of &#147;a national, ethnic, racial or
religious group&#148;, and not a political group. In fact, such
groups were explicitly excluded from the Agreement on genocide, at
the request of the Soviet Union. In other words, the legal aberration
has been committed of applying the criminal law by analogy, a
procedure which was repudiated by ancient doctrine and supported by
theorists throughout history.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#804c19"><FONT SIZE=4>Besides
that, in Pinochet&#146;s case Spanish procedural law and the treaty
on terrorism had to be applied retroactively, if he were to be
accused, against all legal precedents and traditions.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#804c19"><FONT SIZE=4>The
defence of the present Senator, Augusto Pinochet, before the High
Court and the House of Lords in London, was based on his immunity as
diplomat and former Head of State. No attempt was made to counter the
accusations of the Garc&eacute;s-Garz&oacute;n twosome. But these
accusations, as one of the Law Lords surprisingly confirmed, were
treated as an important background, with no reference to the fact
that the whole thing was simply a question of unproved suppositions
and nothing more. So the rejection of his right to <I>habeas corpus</I>
, was in the end based precisely on these suppositions, and the
accused was not given the opportunity to defend himself against the
corresponding charges.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#804c19"><FONT SIZE=4>Moreover,
the decisive vote in the House of Lords was that of a judge involved
personally, as was his wife, in an organisation, Amnesty
International, which was dedicated to opposing the liberty of Augusto
Pinochet and was one of the complainants. This Law Lord was both
judge and accuser and he concealed this fact. The long arm of the
truth, however, did not let him escape.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#804c19"><FONT SIZE=4>Augusto

his decision, Moreno indicated that the Cuban regime could not be
accused of genocide since, although in the accusation they speak of
18,000 assassinations with reference to the carrying out of the death
penalty on the island, there was no existence &#145;of intention to
destroy completely or partially any group&#146;, and, therefore, for
legal purposes, there has been no crime that can be typified as
genocide committed.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

having founded a free and prosperous economy and given to his fellow
