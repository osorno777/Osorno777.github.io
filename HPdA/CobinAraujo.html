 The world rarely quiets itself from wars and other conflicts, and
few wars can be called just from a classically liberal perspective.
Like America&#146;s War for Independence and the War Between the
States, Chile&#146;s struggle against the communists was a just
conflict. The revolution in Chile was an act of self defense against
legal looters and armed bandits. As is inevitable in any war, errors
were made and innocent lives lost. But despite its mistakes, the
revolution left a positive legacy: Chile has a free and prosperous
economy and stable republican institutions. This is the context in
which the British arrest of General Augusto Pinochet, the leader of
Chile&#146;s revolution, must be judged.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>When
Pinochet took over, Chile was experiencing a rapid decay in the
quality of life. Salvador Allende had been elected president victory
in a three-way election, in which he won a minority of the vote and
immediately set about making himself into the dictator of a socialist
country. There were reports of Allende killing dozens or even
hundreds of people in the countryside. He was stealing and
nationalizing private property. There was 1,000 percent inflation
during his 1,000 days of rule. There was much hunger (for those who
were not &#147;in&#148; with the socialists) and it was not uncommon
to see people without shoes.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>Hector
Hevia, a Chilean professor who lived through those chaotic times
recalls, &#147;You had to wait in line for hours to get a piece of
meat you could not eat.&#148; By July 1973, Allende had centralized
control of nearly everything, including replacing the top two men in
every firm with a bureaucrat. In short, Allende was destroying
people&#146;s lives, and Chileans had a right to defend themselves
against him.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>At
the time, Chile was a battleground in the Cold War between the United
States and the Soviet Union. President Allende had proved he was no
democrat by calling for total power to the workers and by undertaking
actions, akin to the socialist revolutions by the Cubans and the
Soviets -- both of whose embassies in Santiago were overflowing with
personnel. Chile was in chaos and armed groups of left and right were
taking over the streets. Civil war was imminent.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>There
were massive demonstrations calling for Allende&#146;s resignation.
On August 22, 1973, the Chilean chamber of deputies passed a
resolution of censure against Allende. Congressional deputies
condemned him and his government for violating the constitution and
the law in order to &#147;institute a totalitarian system absolutely
opposed to the representative system of government that the
Constitution establishes,&#148; and called upon the military to
intervene.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>On
September 11, the Chilean military ousted the Allende government. In
less than 24 hours, the armed forces had consolidated control of the
country. But the Marxists did not retreat quietly into the night.
They reorganized and regrouped and continued to fight against the
government. During the immediate aftermath of Allende&#146;s ouster,
some innocent people were undoubtedly killed. In the tense early
period of the military regime it was not uncommon for civilians
falsely to accuse individuals of being armed leftists in order to
settle private scores. But most of the people killed by the military
were part of the of the armed left.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>According
to the report of the respected Rettig Commission of the democratic
Aylwin government, there were 1,173 deaths, including military
personnel, both during the revolution and in its aftermath, from
September to December 1973. The Rettig Commission reported a total of
2,033 deaths perpetrated by the military during the 17-year military
regime, and 265 deaths of military personnel, civilians killed by
terrorists, and deaths due to general political violence. The deaths
are undercounted on both sides, and the number of people who
disappeared are included in the total.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>The
majority -- 63 percent -- of those killed were members of Marxist
political parties, such as in the Movement of the Revolutionary Left,
an entirely terrorist group, the Manuel Rodriguez Front, entirely
terrorist, the Socialist and Communist parties, both of which had
armed contingents, and of smaller, violent Marxist parties. Sola
Sierra, president of the Group of the Relatives of the
Arrested-Disappeared in Chile, herself a communist, stated that the
percentage of people killed who were affiliated with Marxist parties
was actually much higher, since relatives often feared to publicly
reveal the political affiliation of the dead.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>All
wars have social costs, not the least of which are the occasional
loss of innocent life, and Chile&#146;s anti-Marxist revolution was
no exception. Chile&#146;s war with armed leftist terrorists from
1973 to 1990 led to some regrettable and tragic deaths of innocent
people. Generals made mistakes in the heat of battle and the nature
of guerrilla warfare makes the enemy particularly hard to identify.
There were undoubtedly accidental killings.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>What
would Chile be like today without Pinochet? Take a look at Cuba,
where people are starving during the 39th year of Marxist
dictatorship. Most Chileans feel badly that innocent people died
during Pinochet&#146;s war on Marxist terrorism in Chile, and they
wish some things were done differently. But those who love liberty
should be grateful that Pinochet came to resolve the chaos and terror
fomented by the Marxists in the 1970s and 1980s, and usher in an era
of peace, stable republican governance, and prosperity.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>Now,
the British have arrested Pinochet at the request of a Spanish court,
seeking to prosecute him for various offenses committed during the
revolution. He stands accused of genocide and murder, and everyone
knows that. Western news media seldom reported the terrorist
activities of the communists that Pinochet fought, and Pinochet gets
little sympathy in Europe or North America.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>Things
are very different here in Chile. Most people we have talked to are
uneasy, sad, and even outraged about the arrest. Recent polls put
popular support in Chile for Pinochet&#146;s release at over 75
percent. Alvaro Vial, academic Vice President at Finis Terrae
University, who frequently writes on Chilean political issues for the
national press, said that he believes that perhaps 40 percent of
Chileans would firmly stand behind Pinochet. Then there are probably
another 30 to 40 percent who support his return to Chile out of
reasons of nationalism, if nothing else. The vast majority of
Chileans want Pinochet to be freed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>There
are frequent pro-Pinochet demonstrations in front of the British and
Spanish embassies which sometimes turn violent, as demonstations here
often do. The boulevard in front of the Spanish embassy is at times
sealed off and that embassy, along with the British Ambassador&#146;s
residence, are continually barricaded.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>As
Americans living in Santiago, we see that many Chileans feel helpless
in this situation. They resent that the world does not seem to care
about their views on an issue which is of utmost importance to them.
The man who saved Chile from so much anguish at the hands of Marxists
has now been caught in a snare set by their leftist compatriots in
Europe. Rather than go after the true criminals who retain power by
force (Fidel Castro comes immediately to mind) the world now watches
as the mighty left seeks to destroy the man who saved Chile from
socialist hell.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>We
think Pinochet&#146;s supporters in Chile have a good point. To
charge Pinochet with murder would be as unjust as charging Patrick
Henry or Thomas Jefferson with murdering Redcoats or with
accidentally shooting a neighbor while trying to kill a Redcoat. All
such revolutionaries act in self defense against an oppressive state,
and thus their cause is just, despite tragedies and accidental loss
of innocent lives that might occur.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>The
media in the United States and in Europe have distorted the facts
regarding Pinochet. He stands accused of murder and crimes against
humanity, and that is the beginning and the end of the story as far
as most journalists are concerned. But CNN and of the international
news media rarely reveal details about the terrorist activities of
the communists that Pinochet was fighting. Because of their mostly
leftist bias, most media do not sympathize with Pinochet, or with his
revolution against armed socialists who pushed the country to civil
war.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>Thus,
the media portray Pinochet as a senseless and brutal dictator and
ignore the circumstances in which Pinochet assumed power: to prevent
a bloody, protracted civil war.  Pinochet, and those under his
command, almost certainly were responsible for the death of innocent
people. In the chaos and confusion of war, such tragedies are
inevitable. Those outside the fray would do well to hesitate to pass
judgment on the fallible human beings swept up in the vortex of war.
Pinochet was not pure; no one could be, ever has been, or ever will
be under such circumstances.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>The
American Revolution itself had its share of similar tragedies. Does
that melancholy fact erase the good that was accomplished -- the
establishment of a free society and the defeat of tyranny? Make no
mistake about it: whatever mistakes he made along the way, Pinochet&#146;s
actions resulted in the creation of stable republican institutions
and the transformation of a ruined economy into a prosperous one, to
the benefit of all Chileans. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>Pinochet
carried out an economic and political revolution that successively
devolved power away from the state. Afterward he voluntarily stepped
down from power. In doing so, his successors agreed to give him
immunity from prosecution for misdeeds committed during the
revolution. To us, this seems like a reasonable arrangement; the
revolution was over, peace, prosperity, and a stable republic stood
in the place of chaos, poverty and dictatorship. </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>Classical
liberals cannot exonerate Pinochet for any true crimes he committed,
but we should be willing to view his deeds in the context of the
terrorist war in which they were made. And we should we give him
credit for relinquishing power voluntarily. Pinochet was no tyrant.
Do tyrants usher in more freedom? Do they relinquish their power
voluntarily? Pinochet did both.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>Simultaneously,
we have to recall that the &#147;revolution&#148; that the Marxist
terrorists in the MIR, FMR, and Communist and Socialist parties were
fighting for against the Pinochet government was not to create a
freer society. Rather, if successful, the Marxists would have
re-imposed a socialist dictatorship on Chile.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>While
one cannot completely exonerate Pinochet, he is far less culpable
than any number of living Chinese, Cuban, and North Korean rulers in
terms of human rights violations. Those leftist leaders apparently
can wave their iron scepters and commit atrocities without fear of
international reprisals.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>What
an absurd precedent Pinochet&#146;s arrest sets. Monsters like
Zaire&#146;s Mobutu, Cambodia&#146;s Pol Pot, and most of the
dictators of the communist countries of eastern Europe were not
harangued by world tribunals and the press.  But Pinochet, who
voluntarily stepped down from office and now continues to serve his
country as a member of its Senate, is arrested when he visits
Britain! </FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>It
is difficult to fathom why the British government arrested Pinochet,
apart from public choice possibilities. Apparently playing off the
ignorance about what happened in Chile 25 years ago, British
politicians figure that they can assail Pinochet, a controversial 
but relatively unknown figure from a small, far-off country. They
thus become easy patrons of virtue, garners of the public welfare,
and winners of votes.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>The
British, Swiss, and Spanish apparently think it is fine for their
governments to hold Pinochet accountable for the things he did during
the terrorist war regardless of what was happening in Chile at the
time that caused him to act as he did. Why don&#146;t they give him a
peace prize for saving so many people? It seems that one could make
that case more strongly than a murder case, at least if one wants to
try to calculate net social benefits (which seems to be popular among
interventionist courts driven by social justice concerns). More
importantly, should classical liberals support the emergence of a
one-world court, which would enable the interventionist state to rule
conduct on a global scale?</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>Those
want to point out the faults of Pinochet must be careful lest their
arguments condemn Thomas Jefferson, Simon Bolivar, Patrick Henry,
George Washington, and Robert E. Lee as well. We admire Pinochet, as
we admire Jefferson, Bolivar, and other champions of freedom for the
overall good that each did, and the justice of the cause of fighting
tyranny to which they devoted their lives. Thus, we are willing to
overlook many of their errors as tragedies of history and indirect
consequences of living in a world dominated by the evil and
interventionist state.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY><BR>
</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#889992"><FONT SIZE=4>   
Anyone who cares about the truth ought to weigh Pinochet&#146;s
heroic accomplishments against the spurious claims of a biased media
and self-righteous European hypocrites. In the end, whatever his
faults, Pinochet has done more for the cause of freedom than all of
them put together.</FONT></FONT></P>
