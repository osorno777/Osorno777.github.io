He has also written on applied microeconomic topics, policy issues such as abortion, and this introductory text <I>A Primer on Modern Themes in Free Market Economics and Policy</I> (Boca Raton, Florida: Universal Publishers, 1999, and revised and republised by <a href="http://www.policyofliberty.net/checkout/products">Alertness Books</a> in 2003) covering public choice, Austrian economics, law and economics, and public policy themes. This book is also published in Spanish as <I>Ensayos Sobre Temas Modernos de la conom&iacute;a y la pol&iacute;tica de Mercado</I> (Universidad Finis Terrae 1999 and Universal Publishers 1999 (revised and reprinted by <a href="http://www.policyofliberty.net/checkout/products">Alertness Books</a> in 2003)). Dr. Cobin has also written <I>Bible and Government: Public Policy from a Christian Perspective</I> and <I>Pro-Life Policy: A Perspective for Liberty and Human Rights</I> (both with <a href="http://www.policyofliberty.net/checkout/products">Alertness Books</a>, 2003).
