<P ALIGN=CENTER><b>My (Brief) Personal Testimony</b></p>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><i>February 14, 2001</i></p>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Having been raised in a godless home, I first encountered a Bible at the age 
of 15. Some friends from the Grace Brethren Church in Seal Beach, 
California invited me to a Bible study. During the times I went, various 
parts of the Word were reviewed. Looking back I do not think that the depth 
was great, but it was something. I had been leading a rather debauched life 
of carousing, disobedience, selfishness, vandalism, theft, drinking, 
pot-smoking, and various other sins not uncommon to ungodly people then or 
nowadays. When the "rapture" films came around I was shocked into realizing 
that the Lord would return soon and that I was not prepared. I then became keen 
on repenting and turning to Christ, which I did on March 17, 1979 (age 16).</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>A year later I had moved to charismatic circles and was involved regularly at 
Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa (and later in Huntington Beach), California. I 
was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ in the ocean near Newport Beach, 
California a couple of years later. I was zealous, carrying a 6 foot wooden 
cross on the pier in Huntington Beach for a time and witnessing, plastering 
the high school walls and book lockers with "Smile God Loves You" stickers, and leading Bible 
studies on campus and in homes. Frankly, I was a good example of unbridled 
and uneducated zeal. My first years were not illustrious of a godly life 
either, and I must admit that I did not understand the grace of God or what 
it truly meant to be justified by grace through faith alone. However, at 
the age of 19, I had the pleasure of reading Martin Luther's <i>Commentary on 
Galatians</i>, which thoroughly convinced me of God's Providence and purpose in 
grace. I was traveling through Palestine at the time, and I look back on 
those weeks as having had a profound affect on me. There have been times when, 
upon reflection, I wonder if I was truly converted before then.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>After a year of study at the L.I.F.E. (Fousquare) Bible College in Los Angeles, and then a 
semester at Calvary Chapel Bible School in the San Bernardino mountains, I became wholly convinced of the 
truth of the Reformed faith, in its Baptist manifestation, and proceeded to 
attend Reformed Bible College in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I graduated from there with 
an A.R.E. at the age of 21. Ever since then (1984), I have been involved 
with Reformed (usually Baptist) churches. I also ere long jettisoned my belief that 
the "gifts" of the Spirit are continuing today.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Although I have had my own ups and downs, backslidings, and dealings with sin, I can truly see growth 
in my life over the last 22 years. In spite of my failings, God has seen 
fit to use me at various times in a teaching role in the church, including some preaching, leading 
informal meetings, presenting topical Sunday School meetings, and leading home Bible Studies.</P>

<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Certainly now I can say with full confidence that Jesus Christ is my only 
hope for salvation and sustenance in this life, and my chief end is to 
glorify God and to enjoy Him forever. Moreover, I think that I now understand something of 
the sovereignty of God's grace in salvation and in life generally.</P>
