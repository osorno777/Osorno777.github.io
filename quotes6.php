<p class="pl"><b>“The program of [classical] liberalism, condensed into a single word, would have to read: property.”</b>
<br>—Ludwig von Mises<br><br>

<br>—Ludwig von Mises, The Macmillan Book of Business and Economic Quotations, Michael--Jackman (1962)<br><br>
<b>“Everything that is really great and inspiring is created by the individual who can labor in freedom.”</b>
<br>—Albert Einstein, Out Of My Later Years (1950)<br><br>
<b>“The power which a multiple millionaire, who may be my neighbor and perhaps my employer, has over me is very much less than that which the smallest functionaire possesses who wields the coercive power of the state, and on whose discretion it depends whether and how I am to be allowed to live or to work.”</b>
<br>—Friedrich von Hayek, The Road to Serfdom (1944)<br><br>
<b>“I am certain that nothing has done so much to destroy the juridical safeguards of individual freedom as the striving after this mirage of social justice.”</b>
<br>—Friedrich von Hayek, Economic Freedom and Representative Government (1973)<br><br>
<b>“It is of the essence of the demand for equality before the law that people should be treated alike in spite of the fact that they are different.”</b>
<br>—Friedrich von Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty (1960)<br><br>
<b>“The greatest danger to liberty today comes from the men who are most needed and most powerful in modern government, namely, the efficient expert administrators exclusively concerned with what they regard as the public good.”</b>
<br>—Friedrich von Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty (1960)<br><br>
<b>“The great aim of the struggle for liberty has been equality before the law.”</b>
<br>—Friedrich von Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty (1960)<br><br>
<b>“Liberty not only means that the individual has both the opportunity and the burden of choice; it also means that he must bear the consequences of his actions.... Liberty and responsibility are inseparable.”</b>
<br>—Friedrich von Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty (1960)<br><br>
<b>“[W]here the sole employer is the State, opposition means death by slow starvation.”</b>

<b>“We shall all be the gainers if we can create a world fit for small states to live in.”</b>

<b>“Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program.”</b>
<br>—Milton Friedman, favorite saying<br><br>
<b>“Governments never learn. Only people learn.”</b>
<br>—Milton Friedman, favorite saying<br><br>
<b>“History suggests that capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom.”</b>
<br>—Milton Friedman, Capitalism and Freedom (1962)<br><br>
<b>“The Great Depression, like most other periods of severe unemployment, was produced by government mismanagement rather than by any inherent instability of the private economy.”</b>
<br>—Milton Friedman, Capitalism and Freedom (1962)<br><br>
<b>“Inflation is taxation without legislation.”</b>
<br>—Milton Friedman, Comment on President Carter's plan to raise taxes to--reduce inflation (1979)<br><br>
<b>“Most of the energy of political work is devoted to correcting the effects of mismanagement of government.”</b>
<br>—Milton Friedman, PBS 'Firing Line' (October 9, 1988)<br><br>
<b>“What kind of a society isn't structured on greed? The problem of social organization is how to set up an arrangement under which greed will do the least harm.”</b>
<br>—Milton Friedman, The Macmillan Book of Business and Economic Quotations<br><br>
<b>“Most economic fallacies derive ... from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie, that one party can gain only at the expense of another.”</b>
<br>—Milton Friedman with Rose Friedman, Free to Choose (1979)<br><br>
<b>“Self-interest is not myopic selfishness. It is whatever it is that interests the participants, whatever they value, whatever goals they pursue. The scientist seeking to advance the frontiers of his discipline, the missionary seeking to convert infidels to the true faith, the philanthropist seeking to bring comfort to the needy—all are pursuing their interests, as they see them, as they judge them by their own values.”</b>
<br>—Milton Friedman with Rose Friedman, Free to Choose (1979)<br><br>
<b>“There aren't any liberals left in New York. They've all been mugged by now.”</b>
<br>—James Q. Wilson, attributed<br><br>
<b>“In the long run, the public interest depends on private virtue.”</b>

<b>“Incentives to fail [i.e., a description of what the welfare system provides].”</b>
<br>—Charles Murray<br><br>
<b>“We tried to provide more for the poor and produced more poor instead. We tried to remove the barriers to escape poverty, and inadvertently built a trap.”</b>
<br>—Charles Murray, Losing Ground<br><br>
<b>“Many Americans who supported the initial thrust of civil rights, as represented by the Brown v. Board of Education decision and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, later felt betrayed as the original concept of equal individual opportunity evolved toward the concept of equal group results.”</b>
<br>—Thomas Sowell<br><br>
<b>“[T]here are many reasons, besides genes and discrimination, why groups differ in their economic performances and rewards. Groups differ by large amounts demographically, culturally, and geographically — and all these differences have profound effects on incomes and occupations.”</b>
<br>—Thomas Sowell, Civil Rights: Rhetoric or Reality?<br><br>
<b>“Live people are being sacrificed because of what dead people did.”</b>
<br>—Thomas Sowell, New York Times (July 1, 1990), regarding affirmative action and reverse discrimination.</p></td></tr></table><br>
