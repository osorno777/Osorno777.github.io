				This QuickStart quide will help you get up and running with your copy of
				VisitorBook Pro 1.0.0 from Command-O Software! This document assumes that
				VBPro has already been installed. If this is not the case, consult the VBPro
				Documentation for detailed information on first-time setups.
				
				<BR>
				<BR>
				
				<B>Using the Master Admin Program</B>
				
				<BR>
				
				VisitorBook pro lets you set up as few or as many individual guestbooks as you want!
				The Master Admin Program lets you (the administrator) easily add, modify, and
				delete guestbooks from your system.
				
				<BR>
				<BR>
				
				To log in to the administrator program, go to
				<a href="/vbpro/masterlogin.html">Masterlogin</a>
				Next type in the admin information in the form. By
				default, the login name is <i>admin</i> and the password is also <i>admin</i>.
				
				<BR>
				<BR>
				
				You will see three options. All are fairly self-explanitory. When you create a
				VisitorBook (our cool term for a guestbook), you will be asked to select a
				template. For now, you can just use the standard template. Later, you can edit
				options and the look and feel of this book using the <i>Edit a VisitorBook</i>
				function.
				
				<BR>
				<BR>
				
				Also, when you create a new book and it asks for path information, you can safely
				just leave the default paths and create the book (though pay attention to where these
				paths are, for that is where your cook is created.)
				
				<BR>
				<BR>
				
				The Master Admin program takes care of everything when you create a new book --
				it will automatically make a form that will work with the new book, and it
				generates a thank you page for your users after they sign the book.
				
				<BR>
				<BR>
				
				In the <i>Edit a VisitorBook</i> mode, you will see two templates whose
				functions are not obvious: the <i>Book HTML</i> and the <i>Entry Template</i>.
				The <i>Entry Template</i> is the HTML that will be repeased for every
				entry, substituting in the entry information. In a <i>Standard</i> guestbook,
				this template is composed of a few rows of a table. The <i>Book HTML</i>
				contains everything that surrounds the entries. In a <i>Standard</i> guestbook,
				the <i>Book HTML</i> template is a basic HTML page with the skeleton of a table.
				
				<BR>
				<BR>
				
				<B>Using the User Admin Screen</B>
				
				<BR>
				
				The user admin screen is very similar to the Master Admin screen, though it has
				a crucial difference: it can only be used on one book. This means to log in (using
				the <a href="/vbpro/userlogin.html">userlogin</a> form), you need a book id (the ID of a book in the system) and
				the corresponding password.
				
				<BR>
				<BR>
				
				Once you (or your <I>user</I>) has logged in, he or she will be able to edit the book
				as well as process entries. Additionally, this is where entries requiring approval
				(set by an option on the <i>Edit VisitorBook</i> screen) and approved or deleted.
