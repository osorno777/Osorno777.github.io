<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The script is designed to be installed via FTP to a remote server 
running PERL 5 or higher.  Designed for easy setup and configuration, 
This free for all links is capable of powerful filtering that can prevent undesirable links
being added to your site.

<br><br>
The archive contains 10 files.<br>
index.cgi     - The perl script.<br>
affa.cfg    - The configuration file.<br>
header.htm  - The header is attached to the top of the link list.<br>
footer.htm  - The footer is attached to the bottom of the link list.<br>
db.txt      - An empty file used to store the links.<br>
email.txt   - A template to change to modify the email autoresponse.<br>
manual.txt  - The instruction manual for AFFA.<br>
The last 3 files are not required to make the script work and should not be uploaded to your website.

<br><br>
<br><br>
The script can be loaded in your web browser in one of 2 ways.  The first is calling the index.cgi file 
directly.  For example:<br>
http://www.yourdomain.com/links/index.cgi<br>
In which case, do not supply a target file in the affa.cfg file.<br>
Or you can load a page created by AFFA, like this:<br>
http://www.yourdomain.com/directory/links.htm (we have installed it to run via index.cgi)<br>
<P>

<A NAME="configuration">
<H2>Customizing AFFA</H2>

AFFA automatically generates an HTML file by first pre-pending a header HTML
file, then formatting and laying-out the database file of links and finally by
appending a footer HTML file. Sample header and footer HTML files are supplied
with this distribution.
<br><br>
The main things you may wish to change are the Administrator email and the 
TextReject field, which lists words that the script will not accept in a posting.<br><br>
You will probably want to change the header.htm and footer.htm files to add your
company details, advertising and some links.  Just be careful not to alter the working
parts of the page.  It is best to make a spare copy of the original file before altering it.
<br><br>
<P>You can use AFFA as-is straight away (you should put your email address in the 
Administrator field in the affa.cfg file however), or customize nearly every aspect of its
operation. AFFA is configured through a configuration file (`AFFA.cfg') that you
can edit with a text editor. The file itself contains comments (any line
starting with a `#') that describe each of the options. In summary, the
following configuration options are available:

<H4>System Errors</H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>System Error 1</STRONG>
<DD>AFFA was unable to open the database file for updating; this is almost
    always caused by incorrect permission settings on the database file. 

<DT><STRONG>System Error 2</STRONG>
<DD>You have enabled automatic URL-testing, however AFFA could not find the
    necessary library (PERL library Socket.pm) to achieve this. Check your
    PERL installation, or disable automatic URL-testing.

<DT><STRONG>System Error 3</STRONG>
<DD>You have configured an invalid substitution in the
    <A HREF="#configuration">config file</A>
    (<A HREF="#substitutelist">SubstituteList</A>). Please check the
    substitution format carefully.

<DT><STRONG>System Error 4</STRONG>
<DD>AFFA was unable to open the target HTML file for updating; this is almost
    always caused by incorrect permission settings on the target HTML file
    file. 

<DT><STRONG>System Error 5</STRONG>
<DD>AFFA was unable to open the log file for updating; this is almost always
    caused by incorrect permission settings on the log file. 

<DT><STRONG>System Error 6</STRONG>
<DD>The <A HREF="#configuration">config file</A> could not be opened for
    reading. The config file should be named `AFFA.cfg' in the same directory
    as AFFA, unless otherwise in the header of AFFA (edit the script to modify).

<DT><STRONG>System Error 7</STRONG>
<DD>The <A HREF="#configuration">config file</A> contains an error at the line
    given. Check for syntax errors and typos.
