<br><p class="pl"><b>"In this volume, John Cobin persuasively illustrates that the pro-life position is essentially liberal, from both economic and philosophical perspectives. The exposition is clear and simple and the many appendices make this work suitable for use in the classroom as well. Dr. Cobin was instrumental in refining my thinking on this subject and his book is highly recommended.”</b>
<br>— Joseph S Fulda, CSE, PhD</p>
<br><p class="pl">This book provides a non-religious, classically liberal defense of the pro-life position derived from economic and public policy analysis, as well as moral philosophy. The debate over abortion at an academic level is quite different that what is popularly discussed. In my experience, it is rare to find pro-choice academics who reject the fact that the zygote/fetus is a life and a human being -- and that abortion is the taking of a life and the killing of a human being. The debate is over personhood. Academic abortion-rights advocates argue that some human beings, notably unborn ones, are not persons because public policy or some other social convention has not conferred rights upon them. This philosophy is not new, but it is well thought thought-out. Jews were not considered persons under Hitler, nor were enslaved negroes in the ante-bellum United States. The rationale for such policies always revolves around some genetic or development criteria, such as the ability to reason (among many others). I argue that this position must be rejected by classical liberals (and conservatives) because it is not in the public interest, because there should be no division of human beings by their peers into rights-bearers and non-rights-bearer (on the contrary, there should be equality among human beings), and because public policy must not be the source of human rights to life. Indeed, we become slaves of the state if the state is able to define who has rights and if it is permitted to grant us rights to our bodies and lives. I make a careful argument based on ideas that are not common in the  debate literature and I hope you will take time to consider what I have to say. I would also highly recommend the excellent essay by philosophy Professor Peter Kreeft, "Personhood Begins at Conception", to be read in conjunction with my book.</p>
